use `magiRuntime.create` to create a new runtime.

pass callbacks to have immediate updates when state changes:
- `runtimeUpdated(runtime)` called when graphs are processed. called even if no changes are made

call `updateRuntime` to update the runtime with new data.
critically, this should happen with the `project` field with the project that is loaded from Rivet.

use `makeSerializeable` to generate an object for saving to JSON

trigger `processGraphs` to begin a graph process. runtimeUpdated will be called when the process is complete.


basic setup:
1. create magi runtime
2. load a rivet project
3. update the runtime with the project
4. process the graphs
