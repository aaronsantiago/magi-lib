use `magiRuntime.create` to create a new runtime.

pass callbacks to have immediate updates when state changes:
- `runtimeUpdated(runtime)` called when graphs are processed. called even if no changes are made

use `makeSerializeable` to generate an object for saving to JSON

trigger `processGraphs` to begin a graph process. runtimeUpdated will be called when the process is complete.
